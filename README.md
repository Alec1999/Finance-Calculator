# Finance-Calculator
A web-based finance calculator that allows users to calculate loan payments, interest rates, and savings growth. Built with [technologies you used, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript], it provides a user-friendly interface for quick financial calculations.|Originally created for Harvard’s CS50 course under my old GitHub account.
